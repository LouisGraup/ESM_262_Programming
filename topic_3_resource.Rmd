#  Finish writing a function and Review

One of the equations used to compute automobile fuel efficiency is as follows this is the power required to keep a car moving at a given speed is as follows:


$Pb = crolling * m *g *V + \frac{1}{2} * A*p_{air}*c_{drag}*V^3$


where crolling and cdrag are rolling and aerodynamic resistive coefficients, typical values are 0.015 and 0.3, respectively.

- V: is vehicle speed (assuming no headwind) in m/s (or mps) m: is vehicle mass in kg

- A is surface area of car $(m^2)$

- *g*: is acceleration due to gravity $(9.8 m/s^2 )$ 

- p_air = density of air $(1.2kg/m^3 )$

- Pb is power in Watts

What would be the function's contract - input/parameters? what will it do?

Write a function to compute power, given a truck of m=31752 kg (parameters for a heavy truck) for a range of different highway speeds (30 m/s, 80 km/hr, 120 km/hr, 40 km/hr )
The surface area is 6 $m^2$

Plot power as a function of speed
Add a second line for lighter vehicle
Remember to keep the function in its own file, store it in a subdirectory called *R* and then create a Rmarkdown to use the function and store the Rmarkdown in a different directory

Good Programming Practices:

Name variables so its easy to understand

Describe the contract at the top of the function (following the format for the *power_gen_orig.R* example

Also include the comments in the Rmarkdown that you are using to run the function
