# Assignment 2 - To Submit


With your group, think of an example program that you might want to design that is complex enough to involve several modules

* write a contract for the overall program (input, output, parameters)
* break the program in to modules (naming them appropriately), wrate a contract for each one
* create a diagram that shows how these modules would be put together to go from inputs to output for the overall program (you can use whatever tools you like to create this)

* summarize this in an Rmarkdown document

*  select a group member and use their group repository

# Review for class

Clone the following repository 

[Example/Review Repo](https://github.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples.git)

  - make sure this is in a completely separate directory from your assignments directory (git doesn't like two different repos in the same place!)
  - find and go through *Rmarkdown/starting_functions.Rmd* BEFORE next class - play with it; come ready to ask questions in class


Next class we will go through how to make a function in R
