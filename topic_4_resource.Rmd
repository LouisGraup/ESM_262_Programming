Try this - make a random sample of fertilizer application, 10 values
with mean of *5* and standard deviation of *0.5*

(user *rnorm* function in R to do this)


Create a random sample of mean annual growth of a crop due to climate variation, 10 values with mean  of *20*, standard deviation of *2*,

Imagine that growth due to combined effects of climate and fertilize effects can be estimates as:

$ 1.8*fertilizer^2-0.5*fertilizer + mean annual growth $

Use a *for* loop to estimate combined growth for each of 10 samples

(you can assume that samples are matched - so you will have 10 growth estimates - using your 10 fertilizer applications and 10 estimates of mean annual growth)

Can you put together in a data structure that lets you plot growth against fertilizer?

*No need to hand in*
