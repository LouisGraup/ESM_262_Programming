# Assignment -on your own

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items

* the most common fish, 
* the rarest fish
* the total number of fish

Create an Rmarkdown to demonstrate the use of your function with fish.txt - which
is under Data on ESM_262_Examples

[Data on ESM_262_Examples]{https://github.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples/blob/main/Data/fish.txt}


Turn in on Gauchospace what your function returns when you run with fish.txt!

Challenge: What if we had multiple catches - how would you run your summary function for all of those catches - see below for an example to generate multiple catches
You don't have to run this one in but we will go over in class

```{r  challenge}
# generate some data if we had 10 different fishing days
# some examples of using the purr family of functions

possible.fish = c("salmon","steelhead","shark","tuna","cod")

# lets generate random sample of the number of fish caught on each day
ndays=10
catches = round(runif(min=3, max=400, n=ndays))

# now for each fishing day (and its number of fish caught) - use sample to genreate the fish
catches_res = list(catches) %>% pmap(sample, x=possible.fish, replace=TRUE)
# look at the sample catches
catches_res[[1]]
catches_res[[10]]

# ok so how do we get the summary (rarest fish, number of fish for all catches in catch_res)?

```


Also review the classify_lake.R function from today's lecture to make sure you understand
