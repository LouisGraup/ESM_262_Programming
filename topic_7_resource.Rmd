# Assignment - Group

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items
* the most common fish, 
* the rarest fish
* the total number of fish
AND
 include an option (defaulted to FALSE) that if TRUE also returns a histogram of the number of each fish type, with a title giving the total number of fish caught.  Remember that you can save a graph as a variable.

Create an Rmarkdown to demonstrate the use of your function with *fish.txt*

# REVIEW for next class
