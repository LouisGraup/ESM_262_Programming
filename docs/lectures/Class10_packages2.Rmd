# <span style="color:orange">Creating Packages</span>

* creating and link with github

* edit your DESCRIPTION file to add title, descripition of your package

* populate with R functions

* run *document()* to create help files

* repeat as needed adding functions as you go *build* and *load* as you go

* add package dependencies with * **usethis::use_package("name")** * which updates your DESCRIPITION file

## Next

* add data

* add testing

* share your package

# <span style="color:orange"> Data stored with packages</span>

Reminder:
To access a dataset that has been stored with a package

**data(name)**

There are numerous data sets stored with the base R package
try 

`data(CO2)'

`help(CO2)'

This is a data set on carbon dioxide uptake in plants - note that it always has help documentation that is similar to functions

You can then refer to that dataset as an object in your workspace

# Storing your own data

* have the dataset (e.g *fish*) in your workspace (e.g you've already read it in)
   

* save the data to the data subdirectory of your package using:
  * use_data(name, pkg="packagename")
  * eg. *use_data(fish, pkg=ESM262Examples)*

* dataset will be stored as *data/name.rda* in your package

Try this


# Documenting Data Sets for Packages

You can also create help pages for your dataset, the format is similar to what you use to document functions, what differs is where you put the documentation code

Here's an example 

Data Documentation example ![](../img/datadoc.jpeg)

# Steps for documenting data sets

* store documentation as a file (dataname.R) 
 (e.g **R/clim.R**)
save that file in the *R* subdirectory of your package

* this file will contain ONLY the documentation for the data set

* when you rebuild or run document - documentation will be created with roxygen2

* format is similar to documentation for function but you will use some different identifiers for documentation including:
    * title
    * descripition
    * \@format
    * \@source
    * \\itemize - itemize allows you to describe the data (see example above)

  * end the file with the name of your dataset (in data directory) in quotes
  
  * set your working directory to your project directory 
  
  * once you've generated the documentation - run *document(dataname)* and try *help(dataname)* to test
  



Generate some data and store it with your package


```{r usingdata, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

data(clim)
help(clim)
spring_summary(clim)

```
# <span style="color:orange">Testing</span>

For all of your functions; you should write at least one test

Put that test into the *tests* directory
    *test_functionname.R*
    
Run tests_dir() frequently


# <span style="color:orange">Giving the package to others</span>


To give the package to others - (who will simply be using it)

* build a source package (see build directory)

* this will create an *.gz file that you can distribute

* the user will then **install** this package (see installation menu, go to install from *.gz files) in order to have access to functions and data in your package


Alternatively if your users are used to *github* you can use 

*devtools::install_github("yourname/packagename")*

This can be a good way to share the package with yourself :)


# <span style="color:orange">Vignettes</span>

Vignettes are additional documentation on how to use your packages (and/or functions
within the package) that provide example uses
* usually written in *Rmarkdown*

You can see available vignettes for all currently loaded packages with

**vignette()**

or for a particular package

**vignette(package="dplyr")**

To actually see the vignette (comes up in help window)
**vignette("two-table")**

Basic outline for making a vignette for your package

* write with *R markdown*
* store in a **vignettes** subdirectory of the package structure
* run **build_vignettes()**

Running **build_vignettes()** will create some additional subdirectories **doc** and **Meta**
after build you need to reinstall with build vignette flag on

**install(buld_vignettes=TRUE)**
**library(package_name)**

and re load your library!

A few technical details first

* add the following to the top of the my-vignette.Rmd (and edit **my_vignette** with your names)

```{black, type='a'}
---
title: "my-vignette"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{my-vignette}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---
```

* note that you can have more than one vignette in a package

* you may need to add the following lines to **DESCRIPTION**

```{black, type='a'}

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown
VignetteBuilder: knitr

```

See **esm237examplesS18/vignettes/using_climate_summaries.Rmd**


Try to make a vignette for your function
