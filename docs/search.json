The course provides practical training in software design best practices. Topics include programming language concepts; modular program design; data structures and flow control, version control, testing, documentation and reproducibility. The course features R for programming, Git for version control, Markdown for workflow, and GitHub for collaboration and publishing, but many concepts would be applicable in other software design tools. Class will include a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students’ own computers.\nLectures: MW 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM (Bren Hall 1510)\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Naomi Tague (www.tagueteamlab.org)\nOffice hours: Friday 9pm - 11pm\nemail (tague@ucsb.edu)\ngit user id naomitague\nTeaching assistant: Louis Graup\nOffice hours: Saturday 7am - 8am\nemail (lgraup@bren.ucsb.edu)\ngit user id LouisGraup\nLearning objectives\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMake sure you have installed git, R, R-studio\nPlease bring your laptop to class\nMake sure you have a Github account\nAssignments\nThere will be 6 short assignment (more or less one for each class). You will usually have time to work on the assignment in class and most will be in groups. We’ll evaluate your assignments by pulling the GitHub repository that they live in.\nTo set this up:\nCreate a single private git hub repo to hold all of your assignments (and nothing else!).\nInvite Louis (’LouisGraup) and Naomi (naomitague`) to collaborate on this repo.\nThen, for each assignment:\nPut your solution, and all the files needed to run it, in its own folder within the repo.\nSubmit the URL of the folder on Gauchospace\nWeekly Schedule\nClass\nLecture topics\nLab topics\n1\nTopics\nTopics\n2\nTopics\nTopics\n3\nTopics\nTopics\n4\nTopics\nTopics\n5\nTopics\nTopics\n6\nTopics\nTopics\n7\nTopics\nTopics\n8\nTopics\nTopics\n9\nTopics\nTopics\n10\nTopics\nTopics\n\n\n\n",

but it is useful to think about them separately in designing the model - collectively they are sometimes referred to as arguments\nALWAYS USE Meaningful names for your function, its parameters and variables calculated within the function\nIn R we combine inputs/parameters in the first line of the function definition\nwe can provide “default” values that can be overwritten by the function user\nBody includes all calculations between { and }\nanything inside the body is not “seen” by the workspace so you can re-use variables\n\nreturn tells R what the output is\nHere’s our example\n\n\n# function definition\npower_gen_orig = function(height, flow, rho=1000, g=9.8, Keff=0.8) {\nresult = rho * height * flow * g * Keff\nreturn(result)\n}\n\n\n\nUsing the function and scoping\nTo use the function we substitute “actual” values for each argument (parameter and inputs) (unless there are defaults)\nR assumes that arguments are in the order that they were specified in the function definition - unless you refer to them by name\n\n\npower_gen_orig(20,1)\n\n\n[1] 156800\n\npower_gen_orig(height=20, flow=1)\n\n\n[1] 156800\n\npower_gen_orig(flow=1, height=20)\n\n\n[1] 156800\n\n# change the defaults\n# what if efficiencies is less\n\npower_gen_orig(20,1, Keff=0.2)\n\n\n[1] 39200\n\nScoping\nThe scope of a variable in a program defines where it can be “seen” Variables defined inside a function cannot be “seen” outside of that function\nThere are advantages to this - the interior of the building block does not ‘interfere’ with other parts of the program\nSee below\n\n\n# specifying function name without () shows code\n# try it for internal R functions\npower_gen_orig\n\n\nfunction(height, flow, rho=1000, g=9.8, Keff=0.8) {\nresult = rho * height * flow * g * Keff\nreturn(result)\n}\n<bytecode: 0x7feda9de8bb0>\n\n# use the function and save the results\nreservoir1 = power_gen_orig(height=4, flow=7)\n\nreservoir2 = power_gen_orig(height=4, flow=7, Keff=0.2)\n\n# note that internal variables are not defined so these R statements will FAIL\nheight\n\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'height' not found\n\nKeff\n\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Keff' not found\n\nresults\n\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'results' not found\n\n# only the outputs are in your workspace\nreservoir1\n\n\n[1] 219520\n\nreservoir2\n\n\n[1] 54880\n\nSome conventions (helpful later in the course)\nAlways write your function in a text editor and then copy into R\nBy convention we name files with functions in them by the name of the function.R e.g. power_gen.R\nyou can have R read a text file by source(“power_gen.R”) - make sure you are in the right working directory\nkeep organized by keeping all functions in a subdirectory called R\nInclude comments both in the body of the function and at the top - there is a particular style of adding comments to the top of the function that we will use later to generate automatic documentation - so useful to start to follow it, more or less, now - see power_gen.R for the style\nEventually we will want our function to be part of a package (a library of many functions) - to create a package you must use this convention (name.R) place all function in a directory called “R”\n\n\n\n",

It’ll look weird like this (for the Zen Dots Google Font):\n    <style>\n    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Zen+Dots&display=swap');\n    <\/style> \nCopy everything BETWEEN (but excluding) the ending <style> and <\/style>tags\nPaste the @import line you’ve copied into the top section of theme.css near the other fonts imported there. It is now available for use in your theme.\nUpdate the css with your new fonts, replacing the existing font names with the name you’ve imported. You might want to use a Find & Replace All if you want to make sure you’re updating a font everywhere it appears in the current theme.\nRepeat for as many different fonts as you want to update in your theme.\n\n\n\n",
