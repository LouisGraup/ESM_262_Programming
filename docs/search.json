The course provides practical training in software design best practices. Topics include programming language concepts; modular program design; data structures and flow control, version control, testing, documentation and reproducibility. The course features R for programming, Git for version control, Markdown for workflow, and GitHub for collaboration and publishing, but many concepts would be applicable in other software design tools. Class will include a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students’ own computers.\nLectures: MW 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM (Bren Hall 1510)\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Naomi Tague (www.tagueteamlab.org)\nOffice hours: Friday 9pm - 11pm\nemail (tague@ucsb.edu)\ngit user id naomitague\nTeaching assistant: Louis Graup\nOffice hours: Saturday 7am - 8am\nemail (lgraup@bren.ucsb.edu)\ngit user id LouisGraup\nLearning objectives\n3 BIG concepts in programming are modulariy, data structure, looping - we will learns skills related to all three of these\nlearn and practice some coding/programming best practices (that will make your data science life easier - whatever you do!)\ndocumentation\ntesting\n\nlearn some new Rskills that are helpful for a wide variety of data science applications\npractice partner coding\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMake sure you have installed git, R, R-studio\nPlease bring your laptop to class\nMake sure you have a Github account\nCourse materials and how we will work\nAll lecture materials will be available on this course website as well as assignments. (But you will submit assignments on Gauchospace)\nPrior to most classes, I will ask you to study an Rmarkdown document (and often an example R-functions) before class Then at the beginning of class, I will briefly go over the document and we will discuss any questions. Occasionally I spend 10-15 minutes lecturing. We will spend most of the class working on practical applications of what was in the document. This way we use the class time as a lab - where you can get guidance.\nthis mean its essential for you to do the review before class \nWhy structure it this way? You learn to code by doing - not so much by watching others do!\nAssignments\nThere will be 6 short assignment (more or less one for each class). You will usually have time to work on the assignment in class and most will be in groups. We’ll evaluate your assignments by pulling the GitHub repository that they live in.\nTo set this up:\nCreate a single private git hub repo to hold all of your assignments (and nothing else!).\nInvite Louis (’LouisGraup) and Naomi (naomitague`) to collaborate on this repo.\nThen, for each assignment:\nPut your solution, and all the files needed to run it, in its own folder within the repo.\nSubmit the URL of the folder on Gauchospace\nWeekly Schedule\nClass\nLecture topics\nLab topics\n1\nTopics\nTopics\n2\nTopics\nTopics\n3\nTopics\nTopics\n4\nTopics\nTopics\n5\nTopics\nTopics\n6\nTopics\nTopics\n7\nTopics\nTopics\n8\nTopics\nTopics\n9\nTopics\nTopics\n10\nTopics\nTopics\n\n\n\n",

I think most of them are most useful when you’re trying to make a finalized table with data in it, but if you really want to beautify your website tables there are options.\n\n\n\n",

You can be flexible here - if you want you can think of extremes as only occurring when you have temperature above a threshold for a sequence several days (and the number of days would be another parameter) or something simpler - just any temperature above a threshold; if you want you could have different thresholds to define different “severity” of extremes.\nWhat is risk? You will develop the equation for risk on your own! Be creative here - what might make sense? how might temperature extremes translate into risk; would it be a linear equation- something else? What might be some of the parameters that influence risk (incomes, tree species, age? (include at least two parameters) How many categories of risk will you have\nHave your function return both the risk associated with the input temperature sequence AND then number of extremes\nCode your function in R Make sure you document well\nCreate an Rmarkdown to demonstrate the use of your function with clim.txt - which is under Data on ESM_262_Examples\n[Data on ESM_262_Examples]{https://github.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples/blob/main/Data/clim.txt}\nSubmit the link to the R function code and your Rmarkdown on Gauchospace\nReview Testing.Rmd\n\n\n\n",

Here, only using Google fonts is described (there are other methods for downloading fonts and adding, not included here).\nFonts are imported and specified in theme.css\nIn your Project in RStudio, open the theme.css file.\nNear the top, you’ll see some lines that look like this:\n/* Header font */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sanchez&display=swap');\n\n/* Body font */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito+Sans:wght@300;400&display=swap');\n\n/* Code font (Roboto Mono) */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300;400&display=swap');\nThose are the import command to get 3 different Google fonts (Sanchez, Nunito Sans, and Roboto Mono). You can explore many different Google fonts here.\nUse different fonts\nFind a Google Font you like.\nClick on the font. To the right of the font example text, you should see an option to ‘+ Select this style’. Click the one(s) you want to select.\nThat will probably bring up a side menu. If you don’t see that side menu, you can see your selected styles at any time by clicking on the top-right menu icon that is a grid with 3 squares and a plus sign - hovering reveals this is to ‘View your selected families’. In the Use on the web section of the side menu that appears, select the radio button for @import. It’ll look weird like this (for the Zen Dots Google Font):\n    <style>\n    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Zen+Dots&display=swap');\n    <\/style> \nCopy everything BETWEEN (but excluding) the ending <style> and <\/style>tags\nPaste the @import line you’ve copied into the top section of theme.css near the other fonts imported there. It is now available for use in your theme.\nUpdate the css with your new fonts, replacing the existing font names with the name you’ve imported. You might want to use a Find & Replace All if you want to make sure you’re updating a font everywhere it appears in the current theme.\nRepeat for as many different fonts as you want to update in your theme.\n\n\n\n",
