The course provides practical training in software design best practices. Topics include programming language concepts; modular program design; data structures and flow control, version control, testing, documentation and reproducibility. The course features R for programming, Git for version control, Markdown for workflow, and GitHub for collaboration and publishing, but many concepts would be applicable in other software design tools.\nClass will include a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students’ own computers.\nLectures: MW 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM (Bren Hall 1510)\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Louis Graup (www.louisgraup.com)\nOffice: Bren 1005\nOffice hours: MW 11 AM - 1 PM\nemail (lgraup@ucsb.edu)\ngit user id LouisGraup\nTeaching assistant: Ojas S\nOffice hours: Tuesday / Thursday 3pm-4pm\nemail (ojassarup@ucsb.edu )\ngit user id osarup\nLearning objectives\n3 BIG concepts in programming are modularity, data structure, looping - we will learns skills related to all three of these\nlearn and practice some coding/programming best practices (that will make your data science life easier - whatever you do!)\ndocumentation\ntesting\n\nlearn some new Rskills that are helpful for a wide variety of data science applications\npractice partner coding\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMake sure you have installed git, R, R-studio\nPlease bring your laptop to class\nMake sure you have a Github account\nCourse materials and how we will work\nAll lecture materials will be available on this course website as well as assignments. (But you will submit assignments on Gauchospace)\nPrior to most classes, I will ask you to study an Rmarkdown document (and often an example R-functions) before class\nThen at the beginning of class, I will briefly go over the document and we will discuss any questions. Occasionally I spend 10-15 minutes lecturing. We will spend most of the class working on practical applications of what was in the document. This way we use the class time as a lab - where you can get guidance.\nthis mean its essential for you to do the review before class \nWhy structure it this way?\nYou learn to code by doing - not so much by watching others do!\nAssignments\nThere will be 6 short assignment (more or less one for each class). You will usually have time to work on the assignment in class and most will be in groups. We’ll evaluate your assignments by pulling the GitHub repository that they live in.\nTo set this up:\nCreate a single private git hub repo to hold all of your assignments (and nothing else!).\nInvite Ojas (’osarup) and Louis (LouisGraup`) to collaborate on this repo.\nThen, for each assignment:\nPut your solution, and all the files needed to run it, in its own folder within the repo.\nSubmit the URL of the folder on Gauchospace\n\n\n\n",

I think most of them are most useful when you’re trying to make a finalized table with data in it, but if you really want to beautify your website tables there are options.\n\n\n\n",
