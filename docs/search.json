The course provides practical training in software design\nbest practices. Topics include programming language concepts; modular\nprogram design; data structures and flow control, version control,\ntesting, documentation and reproducibility. The course features\nR for programming, Git for version\ncontrol, Markdown for workflow, and\nGitHub for collaboration and publishing, but many\nconcepts would be applicable in other software design tools. Class will\ninclude a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students’ own\ncomputers.\nLectures: MW 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM (Bren Hall\n1510)\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Naomi Tague (www.tagueteamlab.org)\nOffice hours: Friday 9pm - 11pm\nemail (tague@ucsb.edu)\ngit user id naomitague\nTeaching assistant: Louis Graup\nOffice hours: Saturday 7am - 8am\nemail (lgraup@bren.ucsb.edu)\ngit user id LouisGraup\nLearning objectives\n3 BIG concepts in programming are modulariy,\ndata structure, looping - we will learns skills\nrelated to all three of these\nlearn and practice some coding/programming best practices (that\nwill make your data science life easier - whatever you do!)\ndocumentation\ntesting\n\nlearn some new Rskills that are helpful for a wide variety of\ndata science applications\npractice partner coding\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMake sure you have installed git, R, R-studio\nPlease bring your laptop to class\nMake sure you have a Github account\nCourse materials and how\nwe will work\nAll lecture materials will be available on this course website as\nwell as assignments. (But you will submit assignments on\nGauchospace)\nPrior to most classes, I will ask you to study an Rmarkdown document\n(and often an example R-functions) before class Then at the beginning of\nclass, I will briefly go over the document and we will\ndiscuss any questions. Occasionally I spend 10-15 minutes lecturing. We\nwill spend most of the class working on practical applications of what\nwas in the document. This way we use the class time as a lab - where you\ncan get guidance.\nthis mean its essential for you to do the review before class\n\nWhy structure it this way? You learn to code by doing - not so much\nby watching others do!\nAssignments\nThere will be 6 short assignment (more or less one for each class).\nYou will usually have time to work on the assignment in class and most\nwill be in groups. We’ll evaluate your assignments by pulling the GitHub\nrepository that they live in.\nTo set this up:\nCreate a single private git hub repo to hold all of your assignments\n(and nothing else!).\nInvite Louis (’LouisGraup) and Naomi (naomitague`) to\ncollaborate on this repo.\nThen, for each assignment:\nPut your solution, and all the files needed to run it, in its own\nfolder within the repo.\nSubmit the URL of the folder on Gauchospace\nWeekly Schedule\nClass\nLecture topics\nLab topics\n1\nTopics\nTopics\n2\nTopics\nTopics\n3\nTopics\nTopics\n4\nTopics\nTopics\n5\nTopics\nTopics\n6\nTopics\nTopics\n7\nTopics\nTopics\n8\nTopics\nTopics\n9\nTopics\nTopics\n10\nTopics\nTopics\n\n\n\n",

Here, only\nusing Google fonts is described (there are other methods for downloading\nfonts and adding, not included here).\nFonts are\nimported and specified in theme.css\nIn your Project in RStudio, open the theme.css file.\nNear the top, you’ll see some lines that look like this:\n/* Header font */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sanchez&display=swap');\n\n/* Body font */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito+Sans:wght@300;400&display=swap');\n\n/* Code font (Roboto Mono) */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300;400&display=swap');\nThose are the import command to get 3 different Google fonts\n(Sanchez, Nunito Sans, and Roboto Mono).

To the right of the font example text, you\nshould see an option to ‘+ Select this style’. Click the one(s) you want\nto select.\nThat will probably bring up a side menu.
