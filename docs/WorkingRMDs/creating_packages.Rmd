# <span style="color:orange">Steps for creating a package</span>

* Think of a name for your package, it should be descriptive of the many related functions that you will store there
      * mine will be **rainbow**

* Create repository for this package on **git**

* Back in Rstudio, 
  * start a new project, using the same name for the project as your package name
    * choose the option in package creation to **create a package**
    * make sure that the **path** to this directory is not in the course directory, or other directory that is 
already under version control (git)
    * link to your existing Github repository
    
* If you already have an R function you can add it here
  * make sure your function is named **something.R** and follows the format for functions that we have been using 
  * try adding one of the functions that you created to compute diversity
  
* Install libraries **devtools** and **roxygen2** from CRAN

* Link with a git repository post creation: see project set up on R **Tools** menu

# <span style="color:orange">Making your own packages</span>

You will notice that this creates a directory structure that looks something like this

R Package Directory ![](Rdirstruct.jpeg)

Your R function will be stored in the **R** subdirectory
IF **man** and **data**, **tests** subdirectories are not created - created them

This package (e.g **rainbow**)  directory structures  store your code and documentation; that is easy for R to read. It include

* A file DESCRIPTION with descriptions of the package, author, and license conditions
* A man/ subdirectory of documentation files.
* An R/ subdirectory of R code.
* A data/ subdirectory of datasets.
