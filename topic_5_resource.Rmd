# Assignment 4

For this assignment work in pairs - and submit as a group

* Design a function - you can pick anything - and you can essentially make up the equations as long as they conceptually make sense
Make sure it has at least 2 inputs and 1 parameter (ideally more)

* Code your function in R, save as a R file in subdirectory called R
Make sure you include documentation (both at the top as we've shown in past examples, and inline)
Include some error checking

* In an Rmarkdown file, generate some data for 2 of the function inputs, 
use a for  loop to run the function for the data 
repeat the "looping" using something from the "purrr" package 

* Graph the result (you can decide what the most interesting way to graph is)

* Include your function.R file, and the Rmarkdown in your git repo and submit the link on Gauchospace
Submit as a group with your partner, you will have to fill out the group select on Gauchspace first before you submit

# To Review for next class

* DataTypes.Rmd
