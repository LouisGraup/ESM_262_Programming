# Assignment 4

Working in the groups that you used to build your existing autopower function; 

* add some error checking to your function; save in its own file as usual
* In an Rmarkdown document, using the cars that I generated in class (see Class4_Using_functions_with_data.Rmd on Gauchospace), 

* recreate *possible_cars*, add an additional car with mass 30,000 kg, surface area 10m2

* create a random sample of 100 highways each with a different rolling coefficient; , sample the rolling coefficients from a uniform distribution with a minimum value of 0.01 and a maximum value of 0.03, sample 100 different highways

* use a *for* loop to compute the power for each of 100 different highways for each car in *possible_cars* -  for all calculations consider only a single speed -  120 km/hr. We are assuming this is the average speed driven on all highways

* create a box plot of power consumed for each car type (where the boxes will show ranges across the different highways)

* use *pmap* to repeat your calculations and create a second boxplot

Submit the github link as usual on Gauchospace

# To Review for next class

This is  a short one
* looping2.Rmd
* compute_NPV.R
